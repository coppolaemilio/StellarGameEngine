Introduction
============

The Stellar Game Engine (abbreviated "SGE", pronounced as "Sage") is a
free 2-D game engine.  The purpose of the SGE is to make game
development easier, which allows more rapid development by experienced
game developers and also helps less experienced game developers learn
how to develop games.

Official implementations of the SGE are free software (where "free"
refers to freedom, not price; see the `Free Software Definition
<http://gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html>`_ for more information), and
the documentation has been (to the extent legally possible) released to
the public domain via the CC0 license.

Even if it isn't required of you, we encourage you to release your
games' code under a free software license, such as the GNU General
Public License, the Expat License (often ambiguously called the "MIT
License"), or the Apache License 2.0.  Doing so is easy, does not
negatively affect you, and is highly appreciated as a contribution to
free software.
