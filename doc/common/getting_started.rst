Getting Started
===============

Before you can use the SGE, you need to set up your project.

Setting Up the Project Directory
--------------------------------

The first thing you need to do is create a directory (a folder) for your
project.  This can be anywhere you like, but for the purpose of
explaining, I will use the hypothetical directory "~/my_sge_project".

Once you've created the project directory, copy the SGE implementation
you want to use into the project directory.  For example, if you want to
use the Pygame implementation, assuming your project directory is
"~/my_sge_project", copy the sge-pygame folder (and all of its contents)
into "~/my_sge_project".  You must then rename the folder to just "sge",
so in our example, "~/my_sge_project/sge-pygame" becomes
"~/my_sge_project/sge".
