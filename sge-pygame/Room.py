    This class stores the settings and objects found in a room.  Rooms
    are used to create separate parts of the game, such as levels and
    menu screens.

    Every game must have at least one room.

    Attributes:
    - ``width`` -- The width of the room in pixels.  If set to None,
      ``sge.game.width`` is used.
    - ``height`` -- The height of the room in pixels.  If set to None,
      ``sge.game.height`` is used.
    - ``views`` -- A list containing all View objects in the room.
    - ``background`` -- The `sge.Background` object used.  While it will
      always be the actual object when read, it can be set to either an
      actual background object or the ID of a background.
    - ``background_x`` -- The horizontal position of the background in
      the room.
    - ``background_y`` -- The vertical position of the background in the
      room.

    Read-Only Attributes:
    - ``objects`` -- A tuple containing all `sge.StellarClass` objects
      in the room.
    - ``room_number`` -- The index of this room in the game, where 0 is
      the first room, or None if this room has not been added to a game.
