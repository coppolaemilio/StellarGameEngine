class Music(object):

    """Music handling class.

    This class stores and plays music.  Music is very similar to sound
    effects, but only one music file can be played at a time, and it is
    more efficient for larger files than :class:`sge.Sound`.

    What music formats are supported depends on the implementation of
    the SGE, but Ogg Vorbis is generally a good choice.  See the
    implementation-specific information for a full list of supported
    formats.

    .. note::

       You should avoid the temptation to use MP3 files; MP3 is a
       patent-encumbered format, so many systems do not support it and
       royalties to the patent holders may be required for commercial
       use.  There are many programs which can convert your MP3 files to
       the free Ogg Vorbis format.

    .. attribute:: volume

       The volume of the music in percent from ``0`` to ``100`` (``0``
       for no sound, ``100`` for maximum volume).

    .. attribute:: fname

       The file name of the music given when it was created.
       (Read-only)

    .. attribute:: id

       The unique identifier of the music.  (Read-only)

    .. attribute:: length

       The length of the music in milliseconds.  (Read-only)

    .. attribute:: playing

       Whether or not the music is playing.  (Read-only)

    .. attribute:: position

       The current position (time) playback of the music is at in
       milliseconds.  (Read-only)
