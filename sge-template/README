This is not an implementation of the SGE, but rather a template for
developing your own implementation.

To develop an implementation of SGE:

* Copy the contents of this folder into another directory.
* Define the values of the constants in constants.py.
* Replace the license text on top with appropriate license text for the
  license you intend to use for your implementation.  Suggested license
  choices are the GNU GPL, the GNU LGPL, the Apache License 2.0, or the
  Expat License.
* Replace the "TODO" comments found throughout the Python files with
  actual functionality.
* Insert the name of your implementation into the
  implementation-specific information section of __init__.py and insert
  all important information that is specific to your implementation in
  this section.
* Other than the implementation-specific information section, please do
  NOT modify the docstrings.
