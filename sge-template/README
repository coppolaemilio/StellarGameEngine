========================================================================

This is not an implementation of the SGE, but rather a template for
developing your own implementation.

To develop an implementation of SGE:

* Edit setup.py to include the name of the implementation and proper
  information about it.

Then, go to the "sge" directory and:

* Define the values of the constants in constants.py.
* Replace the license text on top of all source code files with
  appropriate license text for the license you intend to use for your
  implementation.  Suggested license choices are the GNU GPL, the GNU
  LGPL, the Apache License 2.0, or the Expat License.
* Replace the "TODO" comments found throughout the Python files with
  actual functionality.
* Insert the name of your implementation into the
  implementation-specific information section of __init__.py and insert
  all important information that is specific to your implementation in
  this section.
* Other than the implementation-specific information section, please do
  NOT modify the docstrings.
* Replace this README file with a file containing all important
  implementation-specific information.  You can just copy the
  appropriate section from the docstring of __init__.py.

Finally, go to the "doc" directory and:

* Replace "template" in the "sge-template" folder name with a string
  identifying your implementation (assuming a replacement of "template"
  with "foo" for simplicity).
* Change "sge-foo/template.rst" to "sge-foo/foo.rst".
* Modify the contents of "sge-foo/foo.rst" appropriately.
* Use sphinx-quickstart to generate index.rst and other appropriate
  Sphinx files.
* In "sge-foo/index.rst", modify the toctree directive to have a
  maxdepth of 2 and the following sections:
  - intro
  - sge_concepts
  - foo
  - hello_world
  - pong
  - globalvars
  - classes
  - functions
* Use make (e.g. "make html") to generate documentation.
